# hci472_typographic_heirarchies
Assignment for HCI 472 - Fall 2020

Create three different web-based type hierarchies. One should include two typefaces, one should use only one typeface, and the third is your choice.

Use the modular scale that demonstrated in the lectures to determine your sizes. Your hierarchies should include at a minimum seven fonts: H1 - H4, emphasize text, body text and link text.

Create a separate web page for each hierarchy. Display your hierarchies in a webpage something like this. Create your pages in Bootstrap (you should know enough at this point to do that). Add your own CSS to override the default type heirarchies.


Create an index page that links to each of your type hierarchy pages and post a link to your index page with screencaps on the discussion board. Additionally, cut and paste that link in a Word doc and submit to the submissions folder with your screencaps (as PDFs).
